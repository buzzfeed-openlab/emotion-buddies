a trio of data-collecting, touch-sensitive stuffed animals

These plush animals are knit with soft eyelash yarn for texture and resistive yarn for sensitivity. They glow different colors and interact differently based on their "personalities." The happy buddy will pulse its yellow light and purr if squeezed. The angry one will grow redder and growl. The sad one exhibits a blue candlelight pattern that goes out if it is touched.

Each one contains a Particle Internet Button enclosed in a silicone "heart," to protect the electronics and to make them feel more organic.
